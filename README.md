The goal of this repository is to show a step-by-step procedure toward analyzing a big dataset containing hundreds of thousands of transactions. Common steps such as missing value imputation, outlier removal, encoding categorical data, feature selection, model selection, and ensembling are provide in this exmple.

As the focus of this example revolves around the algorithmic part, EDA (exploratory data analysis) is excluded here (but one must note that this step is of great impotance in data analytics if it's not the most important one).
