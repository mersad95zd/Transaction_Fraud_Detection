# Transaction_Fraud_Detection

The goal of this repository is to show a step-by-step procedure toward analyzing a big dataset containing hundreds of thousands of transactions. Common steps such as missing value imputation, outlier removal, encoding categorical data, feature selection, model selection, and ensembling are provide in this exmple.

As the focus of this example revolves around the algorithmic part, EDA (exploratory data analysis) is excluded here (but one must note that this step is of great impotance in data analytics if it's not the most important one).

# Installation
The example is written in python and running the following lines in the command line would install the necessary packages (assuming you are using a docker container):

        apt-get install python3.6
        apt-get install python-sklearn
        apt-get install python-numpy
        apt-get install python-pandas
        apt-get install python-keras
        apt-get install python-scipy
        apt-get install python-missingpy
